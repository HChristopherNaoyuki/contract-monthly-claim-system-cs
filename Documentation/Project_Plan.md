# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) - Project Plan
# Part 1: Project Planning and Prototype Development

## Project Overview
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the monthly claim 
submission and approval process for Independent Contractor lecturers. This document outlines the project plan 
for Part 1 of the development process.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a functional prototype of the Contract Monthly Claim System
2. Create comprehensive documentation including UML diagrams
3. Design a user-friendly interface with minimalist aesthetics
4. Implement core authentication and authorization functionality
5. Establish the foundation for future development phases

## Scope - Part 1 Focus
### Included Features:
- User authentication system (login/register)
- Role-based access control (Lecturer, Programme Coordinator, Academic Manager)
- Basic claim submission interface
- Document upload functionality prototype
- Status tracking interface
- Minimalist user interface

### Out of Scope for Part 1:
- Database integration (using in-memory storage)
- Advanced business logic implementation
- Email notifications
- Advanced reporting features
- Production deployment

- [ ] Prototype testing and validation
- [ ] Final presentation preparation

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack:
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 7.0
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Architecture**: MVC Pattern
- **Authentication**: Session-based
- **Storage**: In-memory collections (for prototype)

### Development Standards:
- Allman-style code formatting
- C# 7.0 language features
- Clean code principles
- Responsive web design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## UML Diagrams Required

### 1. Class Diagram
- User and role classes
- Claim-related entities
- Relationships and associations
- Properties and methods

### 2. Use Case Diagram
- User authentication flows
- Claim submission process
- Approval workflow
- Status tracking functionality

### 3. Sequence Diagrams
- User registration process
- Claim submission workflow
- Document upload process
- Status update mechanism

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond Part 1 requirements
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to requirements specification
   
2. **Technical Complexity**: Implementing Apple-style design
   - Mitigation: Use of CSS frameworks and careful planning
   
3. **Time Management**: Completing all components within timeline
   - Mitigation: Agile development with weekly milestones
   
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring cross-browser functionality
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement and thorough testing

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- Regular code reviews
- Weekly progress assessments
- User testing feedback incorporation
- Backup of all documentation and code

## Resource Allocation

### Human Resources:
- Project Lead: 1 (oversight and coordination)
- Developers: 1 (implementation)
- UI/UX Designer: 1 (interface design)
- Technical Writer: 1 (documentation)

### Technical Resources:
- Development environment: Visual Studio 2022
- Version control: Git/GitHub
- Documentation tools: Markdown, UML modeling tools

## Quality Assurance

### Quality Standards:
