## Overview

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a comprehensive web-based application designed 
to streamline the monthly claim submission and approval process for independent contractor 
lecturers. This system addresses complex administrative challenges through an intuitive, 
role-based interface that serves three distinct user roles: lecturers, program coordinators, 
and academic managers.

**Key Objectives:**
- Simplify claim submission for lecturers
- Streamline approval workflows for coordinators and managers
- Provide real-time status tracking and transparency
- Ensure secure document management
- Maintain audit trails for all claim activities

## System Architecture

The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**Frontend Layer:**
- ASP.NET Core Razor Views
- Modern CSS with Apple-inspired design
- Responsive design for all devices
- Client-side validation with JavaScript

**Business Logic Layer:**
- Controllers handling user requests
- ViewModels for data transfer
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based authorization

**Data Layer:**
- In-memory data storage (prototype phase)
- Entity Framework Core ready
- Scalable to SQL Server database

**Security Layer:**
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Anti-forgery token protection
- Input validation and sanitization
